# Quick Fix Recipe

## Project Title: Quick-Fix-Recipe
## Description: what the site does and how it works
```Quick Fix Recipe is a website that helps user to find recipes for food and drinks. We have three functionalities, user can search drink or meal recipes by name or they can look up recipies randomly, if they like what they saw, they can click the star button and recipe will be saved for them. To use these functions, all users need to do is type the recipe name they want in the search box, choose a category (food or drink) and click "Search", then our website will display the recipes for them. If they want like what they saw and save it to use later, they can simply click the star button. Whenever they want to access the recipes they saved, they can click "MY RECIPES" on the nav bar and our website will bring them to the page where all the saved recipes are. If they do not know what they want or the name of the drink or food or they just want to browse and see cooking ideas, they can click the ""RANDOMIZE, the random recipe will show up. Of course,we also have the home button to bring them to the start page.```
